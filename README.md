# Future improvement
This is a very simple app. Deffinetly would need a way to select (and remove) multiple tasks, way to store data after closing, way to load different lists efficiently, way to move different tasks between each other in a list, way to prioritize different tasks and a way to show which tasks are pending. The general way to sort tasks by date, and a user-frienly interface would also be a good improvement.
